# One Bullet

**A survival game about avoiding your own mistake.**

---

## 🎯 The Concept

You have **one bullet**. Fire it, and it will **never stop**. It bounces off walls, ricochets off obstacles, and hunts you down relentlessly. Your only goal? **Survive as long as you can.**

One Bullet is a minimalist arcade survival game that turns a simple mechanic into an intense, heart-pounding experience. The longer you survive, the faster and more chaotic the bullet becomes.

---

## 🎮 How To Play

1. **Aim** — A rotating indicator shows your firing direction
2. **Fire** — Tap the screen to release your bullet
3. **Dodge** — The bullet bounces forever, getting faster over time
4. **Survive** — One hit and it's game over

The twist? **You create your own chaos.** Every deflector the bullet hits, every wall it bounces off — it all stems from that single shot you fired.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔥 One Bullet, Infinite Chaos
- Fire a single bullet that **never despawns**
- Watch it ricochet off arena walls with realistic physics
- Slight angular deviations prevent predictable patterns — every game is unique

### 📈 Progressive Wave System
The difficulty escalates as you survive longer:

| Wave | Duration | Bullet Speed | Deflector Spawns |
|------|----------|--------------|------------------|
| 1    | 10s      | 380 → 420    | Every 5s         |
| 2    | 12s      | 420 → 480    | Every 4s         |
| 3    | 15s      | 480 → 550    | Every 4s         |
| 4    | 18s      | 550 → 620    | Every 3.5s       |
| 5    | 20s      | 620 → 700    | Every 3s         |
| 6    | ∞        | 700 → 800    | Every 2.5s       |

## 🎯 What Makes One Bullet Unique?

Unlike typical bullet-hell games where enemies attack you, **you are your own enemy**. The bullet you fire becomes your pursuer. This creates a unique psychological tension — every shot you take is a commitment to dodge it forever.

The game rewards:
- **Spatial awareness** — Track the bullet while navigating obstacles
- **Quick reflexes** — React to unexpected ricochets
- **Strategic positioning** — Use deflectors as shields or avoid getting cornered
- **Endurance** — Stay focused as speed and chaos escalate
